# This is a sample configuration file for configuring TeamCity to use external database.
# To make it effective, copy it to the "database.properties" file and modify settings
# according to your environment.
# Do not modify this file, it will be overwritten on TeamCity server startup.
# See documentation at http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/TCD8/Setting+up+an+External+Database

# Database: PostgreSQL

connectionUrl=jdbc:postgresql://<%= @host %>/<%= @name %>
connectionProperties.user=<%= @username %>
connectionProperties.password=<%= @password %>

# The maximum number of connections TeamCity can open on database server.
maxConnections=50

# Specifies whether TeamCity should check each jdbc connection before use.
# It reduces the system performace but avoids cases when the system uses
# a connection that was closed by database server due to time out or this
# connection was broken at the previous operation.
